Comparison between FCFS and SJF (non-preemptive):

1. FCFS (First Come First Serve) schedules processes in the order of their arrival. It does not prioritize based on burst time.
2. SJF (Shortest Job First) schedules processes based on burst time, giving priority to the process with the shortest burst time.
3. SJF typically provides better average waiting time than FCFS as shorter processes get executed first.
4. In the given implementation, SJF is non-preemptive, meaning once a process starts its execution, it runs until completion.
5. While FCFS is simple and straightforward, SJF requires knowledge of the burst time of all processes.
