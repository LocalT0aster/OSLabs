Performance Analysis:

The performance of the three algorithms (First Fit, Best Fit, and Worst Fit) depends on the sequence and nature of allocation and deallocation requests. Generally:

1. First Fit:
   - Fast in finding the first available block.
   - Can lead to memory fragmentation over time, especially with a lot of allocate and clear operations.
   - Typically has a moderate performance.

2. Best Fit:
   - Tends to leave the smallest leftover memory blocks.
   - Can be slower because it searches the entire list to find the best fit.
   - Good for memory utilization but can suffer in terms of speed, especially with a large number of blocks.

3. Worst Fit:
   - Leaves larger leftover memory blocks, potentially reducing fragmentation.
   - Like Best Fit, it can be slower because it searches the entire list.
   - May lead to larger leftover blocks, but this does not always translate to better performance.

In the provided sample, First Fit might perform better in terms of speed because it stops searching as soon as it finds a fitting block. Best Fit and Worst Fit, on the other hand, scan the entire memory each time.

It's essential to understand the nature of allocation and deallocation requests and the requirements for speed and memory efficiency to choose the most suitable algorithm.
